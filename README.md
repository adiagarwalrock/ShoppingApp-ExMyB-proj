# ShoppingApp-proj

To design a basic E-commerce application consisting of products from different categories. 

1) Create a page to add products to the database. (Use rest api for entering/updating data into the database). Each product must be mapped to a certain category
2) Products modification page (updation/deletion).
3) Product details page to show information related to the product.
4) Products listing page per category wise (use REST API's for calling data from the database.) 
5) Implement a search functionality for finding the products. It will be a plus if you will be able to implement search suggestion features.

**Note**:- Python based framework like (Django) is being used to build this application.
