Design a basic ecommerce application consisting of products from different categories. Note:- categories will have sub-categories and each sub-category may have their sub-categories.

1) Create a page to add products to the database. (Use rest api for entering/updating data into the database). Each product must be mapped to a certain category
2) Products modification page (updation/deletion).
3) Product details page to show information related to the product.
4) Products listing page per category wise (use REST API's for calling data from the database.) 
5) Implement a search functionality for finding the products. It will be a plus if you will be able to implement search suggestion features.

**Note**:- You have to use a python based framework like (Django) to build this application.

Post completing your task you have to host it online using heroku or any other platform.
